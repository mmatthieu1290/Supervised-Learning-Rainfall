## Overview

Supervised-Learning-Rainfall is a comprehensive developer tool that predicts rainfall occurrence by harnessing meteorological data and machine learning models. It integrates a trained XGBoost classifier to deliver real-time weather forecasts, supporting environmental monitoring and decision-making.

**Why Supervised-Learning-Rainfall?**

This project simplifies the development and deployment of rainfall prediction systems. The core features include:

- üß™ **üîç Data Analysis & Modeling:** Utilizes Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Model Integration:** Seamlessly incorporates a trained XGBoost model for accurate rainfall classification.
- üöÄ **Real-Time Predictions:** Supports operational deployment with real-time weather data analysis.
- üìä **Actionable Insights:** Transforms raw meteorological data into meaningful forecasts for timely decisions.
- üå¶Ô∏è **Open-Source Flexibility:** Designed for developers to customize and extend for various environmental applications.

## Methodology

**Features:** atmospheric pressure, maximum temperature, mean temperature, minimum temperature, dew point, humidity, cloud coverage, sunshine duration, wind direction, and wind speed.

**Feature selection:** given the complexity and potential multicollinearity among these features, we applied a feature selection process to identify the most informative variables. The final set of selected features includes: Humidity, Cloud coverage, Sunshine duration, Wind speed, and Diff_temp_dewpoint (the difference between air temperature and dew point).

**Model:** XGBoost delivers the best performance.

**Metric:** ROC AUC score is equal to 0.888271.
